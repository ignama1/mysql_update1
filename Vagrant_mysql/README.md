# mysql-vagrant
A simple vagrant box with MySQL.

## Getting started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `vagrant up`

## Connecting to MySQL
Host: `10.19.17.12`  
User: `root`  
Password: `password`  
Port: `3306`

Ensure that MySQL is not running on your machine before starting up, as there will be a port conflict. Vagrant will soon tell you :)
